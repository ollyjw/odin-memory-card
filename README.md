Memory game - each round you are presented with a shuffled set of cards. Click on a card that you have not yet clicked on.

ODIN PROJECT - "The main goal of this project is to implement the concepts learned so far by using hooks to manage and utilize state while fetching and using data from an external API.

Your application should include a scoreboard, which counts the current score, and a “Best Score”, which shows the highest score you’ve achieved thus far. There should be a function that displays the cards in a random order anytime a user clicks one. Be sure to invoke that function when the component mounts.

You also need a handful of cards that display images and possibly informational text. These cards and texts need to be fetched from an external API."
